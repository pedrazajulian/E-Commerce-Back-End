  ## 💻 Usage  
  run "npm i" in the terminal to install the packages needed to run this application.

  create the database in mySQL. run "CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;"

  When the database is created you need create a .env file to store your mySQL username, database name, and password(use the .env.EXAMPLE file for a reference)

  Next you need to seed the database by running "npm seeds/index.js".

  Then you can run "node server.js" in the terminal to run the server.

  Once the server is running you can open insomnia and begin testing the CRUD routes for Category, Product, and Tag.
